# Analysis of Original Auth Implementation
What Worked:
âœ… Basic context provider structure
âœ… Initial localStorage data loading
âœ… Employee/admin role separation

Key Limitations:

State Mutation

Directly modified userData arrays/objects (e.g., elem.tasks.push()), breaking Reactâ€™s immutability requirements.

Sync Issues

Changes in one tab/window didnâ€™t reflect in others due to missing storage event listeners.

Error-Prone Edge Cases

Crashed if:

localStorage was empty/corrupted

taskStats or tasks were undefined

Employee names had case mismatches (firstname vs firstName)

WebSocket Errors

React DevTools threw errors because:

Circular references in context values

Overly broad storage event handling

# Impact:
ðŸ”´ Tasks created by admins didnâ€™t reliably appear in employee dashboards
ðŸ”´ Required page refreshes to see updates
ðŸ”´ Debugging difficulties due to silent failures
